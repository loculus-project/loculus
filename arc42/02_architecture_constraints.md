# Architecture Constraints

Loculus is developed under the following constraints:

### Open Source Software

We decided to develop Loculus under an open source license.
The code is publicly available.

Some aspects why we chose to develop Loculus as open source software:
* to increase transparency of the project,
* to allow others to contribute,
* others are supposed to use the software - they should be able to see how it works.

### Configurability

Loculus is designed to be highly configurable.
It should be usable for different organisms and different use cases.
