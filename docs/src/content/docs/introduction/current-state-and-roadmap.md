description: The current state and roadmap of Loculus
---

The Loculus software is already in a stable stage and used for production systems (see "Known instances" below) and you are welcome to explore this repository and try it out. However, please note that we are planning to revise the configuration files and the APIs before we release the official 1.0. Further, the documentation is so far quite sparse. We plan to release 1.0 with stable APIs and comprehensive documentation by the end of 2024.

If you are looking for a software to manage sequencing data and would like to know whether Loculus might be a suitable tool for you, please feel free to reach out. We would love to hear about your project and take your needs and requirements into consideration when we plan the further development.
