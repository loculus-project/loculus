description: The current state and roadmap of Loculus
---

The Loculus software is already in a stable state and is being used by production systems (see "Known instances" below). You are welcome to explore this repository and try it out yourself. However, please note that we are planning to revise the configuration files and the APIs before the official 1.0 release. Furthermore, the documentation is currently quite sparse. We plan to release 1.0 with stable APIs and comprehensive documentation by the end of 2024.

If you are looking for a software to manage sequencing data and would like to know whether Loculus might be a suitable tool for you, please feel free to reach out. We would love to hear about your project and take your needs and requirements into consideration when we plan the further development.

### Known instances

**[Pathoplexus](https://pathoplexus.org)** is a new initiative to facilitate open sharing of genetic sequencing data for the ebola virus, the West Nile virus and the CCHF virus.

**GenSpectrum** uses Loculus internally to store sequencing data and power its interactive dashboards for analyzing and tracking variants and mutations of viruses. It is currently under development and will be released soon.

If you also host a Loculus instance and would like it to be added to this list, please reach out!
