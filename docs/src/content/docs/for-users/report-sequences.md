description: How to report issues with sequence metadata or incorrectly labeled data
---

If you found an error in a sequence or a mistake in the metadata, you can report this, if it was enabled by your Loculus administrator.

You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

To report a sequence error:

1. Navigate to the sequence details page.
2. Click on the _Report_ button (next to the _Download_ button). This will open a new tab where you can create an issue in a GitHub repository.
3. Follow the instructions in the issue template.
