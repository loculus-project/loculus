This section of the documentation is intended for users of a Loculus instance. If you are reading this page on https://loculus.org, you are viewing the documentation for the latest version of Loculus. Since different instances have different configurations and varying degrees of customization, and some instances might be running older versions, certain features may not be available or behave differently. There might be a specific documentation for the instance that you are using.
