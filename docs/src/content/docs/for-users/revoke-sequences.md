Sequences can be revoked if they contain errors that cannot be corrected.

Note that revoking a sequence **does not delete it**. While it will not turn up in default searches, and will be clearly marked as revoked, it will still be publicly visible.

## How to revoke a sequence

Revocation can only be done by members of the group that originally submitted that sequence.

- Find the sequence you would like to revoke via searching the main database, or by viewing your submitted sequences.
  (Go to 'Submit' and 'View sequences').
- Scroll to the bottom of the sequence page and find the 'Revoke this sequence' button in the bottom-left corner.
- Confirm you want to revoke the sequence
- You will be taken to the sequence review page - press 'Release' to release the revoked sequence
- Confirm you want to release the sequence

The sequence is now revoked.
