# Docs

This directory is used to build the [Loculus documentation site](https://loculus-project.github.io/loculus/), which is based on [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/).

## Project Structure

The directory structure is as follows:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
