# Architecture Constraints

Loculus is developed under the following constraints:

### Open Source Software

We decided to develop Loculus under an open source license.
The code is publicly available.

Some aspects why we chose to develop Loculus as open source software:
* to increase transparency of the project,
* to allow others to contribute,
* to allow others to use the software freely.

### Configurability

Loculus is designed to be highly configurable.
It should be usable for different organisms and different use cases.

#### Suitable For Pathoplexus

While we aim to make Loculus suitable for any maintainer that wants to use it,
we also need to make sure that it is suitable for Pathoplexus. 
Pathoplexus has some specific requirements that Loculus needs to fulfill.
