# Context and Scope

This section puts Loculus into context with the outside world and defines the scope of the project.
All external participants are listed in the diagram below:

![Context View](plantuml/03_context_view.svg)

We provide instructions how to install Loculus, and we host instances ourselves,
but other maintainers can host their own instances as well.
We offer guidance and documentation and are open for feature requests, but we do not provide direct support for custom instances.
We cannot foresee all possible configurations and environments that Loculus might be deployed in.
