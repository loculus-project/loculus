# Keycloakify theme

This is a keycloak theme, built with keycloakify, and branched from https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify-starter


To preview in the storybook:
```
yarn # install dependencies (it's like npm install)
yarn storybook 
```

To build a JAR and package it into an image that copies it to an output directory, build the Dockerfile. (This is done by CI).
