# Keycloakify theme

This is a keycloak theme, built with keycloakify, and branched from <https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify-starter>

To preview in the storybook:

```bash
yarn install --frozen-dependencies # install dependencies (it's like npm install)
yarn storybook
```

To build a JAR and package it into an image that copies it to an output directory, build the Dockerfile. (This is done by CI).
