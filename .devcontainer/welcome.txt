Welcome to the Loculus codespace!

The codespace has begun to be setup. It will not be ready until the postCreateCommand completes.
This may take several minutes.

You can use Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P -> View Creation Log to see the logs of that process.

Once that command has finished, you can open a new terminal and run the command `loculusBackend`,
and then a second terminal in which you can run the command `loculusWebsite`. Once the backend is
started run `loculusPort` in a 3rd terminal to ensure the backend can be accessed properly.
