# Preprocessing Pipeline: Specification

## Introduction

The preprocessing pipeline prepares the data uploaded by the submitters for release. It is a separate program and communicates with the core Loculus backend server through an HTTP interface that we specify in this document. The pipeline can have organism-specific logic and different pipelines can be used for different Loculus instances.

**Note:** The requirements levels (must, should, can, etc.) in this document currently ARE NOT consistent with [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Tasks

In following, we list a series of tasks that the preprocessing pipeline would usually perform. The developers of a preprocessing pipeline have much flexibility in deciding how and to which extent the pipeline does a task: the only rule is that the output of the pipeline has to conform to the format expected by the Loculus backend, see [Technical specification](#technical-specification). For example, a preprocessing pipeline can be very "generous and intelligent" and accept a wide range of values for a date (e.g., it may map "Christmas 2020" to "2020-12-25") or be very restrictive and throw an error for any value that does not follow the ISO-8601 format.

**Parsing:** The preprocessing pipeline receives the input data as strings and transforms them into the right format. For example, assuming there is a field `age` of type `integer`, given an input `{"age": "2"}` the preprocessing pipeline should transform it to `{"age": 2}` (simple type conversion). In another case, assuming there is a field `sequencingDate` of type `date`, the preprocessing pipeline might transform `{"sequencingDate": "30 August 2023"}` to the expected format of `{"sequencingDate": "2023-08-30"}`.

**Validation:** The preprocessing pipeline checks the input data and emits errors or warnings. As mentioned above, the only constraint is that the output of the preprocessing pipeline conforms to the right (technical) format. Otherwise, a pipeline may be generous (e.g., allow every value in the "country" field) or be more restrictive (e.g., only allow a fixed set of values in the "country" field).

**Alignment and translations:** The submitter only provides unaligned nucleotide sequences. If you want to allow searching by nucleotide and amino acid mutations, the preprocessing pipeline needs to perform the alignment and compute the translations to amino acid sequences.

**Annotation:** The preprocessing pipeline can add annotations such as clade/lineage classifications.

**Quality control (QC):** The preprocessing pipeline should check the quality of the sequences (and the metadata).

## Workflow overview

1. The preprocessing pipeline calls the backend and receives some unpreprocessed data.
2. The preprocessing pipeline performs its tasks on the data.
3. The preprocessing pipeline sends the backend the preprocessed data along with a list of errors and warnings.

Sequence entry versions without an error will be released. Sequence entry versions with an error will not be released and require fixing by the submitter. Sequence entry versions without an error but with a warning will be released. The warning will be shown to the submitter (and maybe also to other users).

## Technical specification

Also see the Swagger UI available in the backend at `<backendUrl>/swagger-ui/index.html`.

### Pulling unpreprocessed data

To retrieve unpreprocessed data, the preprocessing pipeline sends a POST request to the backend's `/extract-unprocessed-data` with the request parameter `numberOfSequenceEntries` (integer) and `pipelineVersion` (integer). This returns a response in [NDJSON](http://ndjson.org/) containing at most the specified number of sequence entries. If there are no entries that require preprocessing, an empty file is returned.

In the unprocessed NDJSON, each line contains a sequence entry represented as a JSON object and looks as follows:

```json
{"accession": 1, "version": 1, "data": {"metadata": {...}, "unalignedNucleotideSequences": {...}}, "submitter": insdc_ingest_user, ...}
{"accession": 2, "version": 1, "data": {"metadata": {...}, "unalignedNucleotideSequences": {...}}, "submitter": john_smith, ...}
```

The `metadata` field contains a flat JSON object in which all values are strings. The fields and values correspond to the columns and values as provided by the submitter. Fields present in the metadata file header but left empty by the submitter will be returned as "". Only columns present in the submission metadata file will be keys in the JSON object - independent of the metadata schema.

The primary key is `[accession,version]`. The preprocessing pipeline must be able to handle getting the same sequence entry twice with different versions.

One JSON object has the following fields:

```js
{
    accession: integer,
    version: integer,
    data: {
        metadata: Record<string, string>,
        unalignedNucleotideSequences: Record<string, string>
    }
    submitter: string,
    submissionId: string,
    groupId: int,
    submittedAt: int
}
```

If the pipeline is outdated (i.e., its version is below the currently used pipeline version), the backend will respond with a `422` error.

### Returning preprocessed data

To send back the preprocessed data, the preprocessing pipeline sends a POST request to the backend's `/submit-processed-data` endpoint with the request parameter `pipelineVersion` (integer) and the data as NDJSON in the request body.

In the NDJSON, each row contains a sequence entry version and a list of errors and a list of warnings represented as a JSON object. One JSON object has the following fields:

```js
{
    accession,
    version,
    errors,
    warnings,
    data: {
        metadata,
        unalignedNucleotideSequences,
        alignedNucleotideSequences,
        nucleotideInsertions,
        alignedAminoAcidSequences,
        aminoAcidInsertions
    }
}
```

The response may not contain any unused/unspecified field.

#### Errors and warnings

The `errors` and `warnings` fields contain an array of objects of the following schema:

```js
{
    unprocessedFields: [{
        type: "Metadata" | "NucleotideSequence",
        name: string
    }[],
    processedFields: {
        type: "Metadata" | "NucleotideSequence",
        name: string
    }[],
    message: string
}
```

The `unprocessedFields` field(s) specifies the source of the error. It can be empty if the error is very general or if it is not possible to pinpoint a specific unprocessed metadata source. If the error is caused by the value in a metadata field, the `name` field should contain the name of a metadata field. If a nucleotide sequence caused the error, the `name` field should contain the (segment) name of the nucleotide sequence.

The `processedFields` field(s) work similarly but specify which fields in the processed output are affected by the error or warning.

The `message` should contain a human-readable message describing the error. It may be useful to include the user input in this message.

#### Metadata

The `metadata` field should contain a flat object consisting of the fields specified in the organism instance schema. The values must be correctly typed. Currently, the following types are available:

- `string`
- `int` (integer)
- `float`
- `date` (supplied as a string with complete ISO-8601 date, e.g., "2023-08-30")
- `pango_lineage` (supplied as a string with a properly formatted SARS-CoV-2 Pango lineage, e.g., "B.1.1.7")
- `authors` (comma separated list of authors, treated as a string in the current prepro pipeline)

#### Sequences

The `unalignedNucleotideSequences`, `alignedNucleotideSequences`, and `alignedAminoAcidSequences` fields contain objects with the segment/gene name as key and the sequence as value.
If there is only a single segment (e.g., as in SARS-CoV-2), the segment name of the nucleotide sequence should be `main`.

If a segment or a gene is not present in the sequence, the value should be `null`.

Examples:

SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequence:

```
{
    "main": "..."
}
```

SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequences:

```
{
    "S": "...",
    "N": null,
    ...
}
```

#### Insertions

The `nucleotideInsertions` and `aminoAcidInsertions` fields contain dictionaries from the segment name or gene name to a list of `NucleotideInsertion`s or `AminoAcidInsertion`s. If there are no insertions the list should be empty.

Examples:

Nucleotide insertions for a multi-segmented organism:

```
{
    "seg1": ["248:G", "21881:GAG"],
    "seg2": [],
    ...
}
```

## Reprocessing

The backend accepts processed data from pipelines that have the current or newer version. It will automatically switch to a newer pipeline version if the newer version has successfully processed all sequences that had also been successfully processed by the current version.
