# argocd

This directory contains configuration for the continuous deployment system with [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which provides automated previews for our pull requests.


## GitHub Integration
ArgoCD will aim to build preview instances for any open PR with the `preview` label. It may take 5 minutes for an instance to appear. The preview will appear at `[branch_name].preview.k3s.pathoplexus.org`. Very long branch names, and some special characters, are not supported.

The preview is intended to simulate the full backend and associated containers. It may be necessary to update this directory when changes are made to how containers need to be deployed.

We do not currently support branch names containing underscores and other characters that can't go in domain names.

### Secrets

This repo contains[sealed secrets](https://sealed-secrets.netlify.app/) that allow the pathoplexus-bot to access the GitHub container registry and (separately) the GitHub repository. These are encrypted such that they can only be decrypted on our cluster but are cluster-wide so can be used in any namespace.
