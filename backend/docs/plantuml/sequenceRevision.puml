    frontend -> backend: submit corrected data for existing sequenceIds

    alt sequenceID exists and highest version is 'APPROVED_FOR_RELEASE'
        backend -> DB: insert new version in status 'RECEIVED'
    backend -> frontend: response with sequenceId + new version number
    else
        backend -> frontend: response with error message
    end

    note right of frontend
        At this point the same flow applies as if this was an inital submission
    end note
